## Making changes to the project

####**Create a new branch**

   All local development and changes should be done in appropriately named branches
   (e.g. create a new branch before doing any new major changes)

  `Team > Switch To > New Branch`
  


####**Pushing your changes to github**

   Add all the files that you want all changes to be reflected by
   
     `Team > Add to index`

   Commit all your changes, thereby creating a "savepoint"
   
     `Team > Commit...`  

   Push your changes to github
   
     `Team > Push Branch <branch name>`



####**Do not merge your changes directly into your local master branch and push to Git**

   If you are done developing the component you are working on, push your
   branch to GitHub.

   After that, visit the

   [Git repository page](//github.com/sohjunjie/RRPSS/) and open a

   pull request to the `master` branch.

   Give your pull request a title and describe what you are trying to do
   and self-review your code. Merge to master only if you are sure of 
   your changes. If not, get someone to review your code.
